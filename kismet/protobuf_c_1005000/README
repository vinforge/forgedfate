This directory contains pre-compiled versions of the protobuf headers for protobuf-c 1.3.3,
the most common distributed version.

Due to changes in the main protobuf library, the latest versions of protobufs cannot be 
used with proto-c to compile to C headers, so this stop-gap measure is necessary.
