# Kismet filter configuration
#
# This configuration file is part of the Kismet configuration.  It is loaded
# by the kismet.conf main configuration file.
#
# For more information about the configuration options, see the comments in this
# file and the documentation at:
# https://www.kismetwireless.net/docs/readme/configuring/configfiles/
#
# You can edit the values in these files, but to make it much easier to update Kismet
# in the future, you should put your changes in the kismet_site.conf override file.
# You can learn more about the override config at:
# https://www.kismetwireless.net/docs/readme/configuring/configfiles/?#customizing-configs-with-kismet_siteconf

# Various filter options for different parts of Kismet; These can be combined
# with live filter control for scripted behavior.
#
# In general, you should place filter options in kismet_site.conf as per the
# override config documentation:
# https://www.kismetwireless.net/docs/readme/configuring/configfiles/
#
# This will prevent filter options being overwritten if Kismet is upgraded.

# Nearly all the options in this file are commented out - Kismet does not do 
# filtering by default, and under typical use, users will likely not want filtering.


# Signal threshold filtering for locational information
# Kismet logs ALL packets with signal data, regardless of this option.
# With this threshold set, Kismet will not consider packets with signals weaker than this
# threshold for the running average location calculations.
#
# Signal is in dBm and applied to all packet types; packet types which do not report a 
# signal level will use all packets.
#
# A strong or weak signal may not indicate distance, enable this option with caution.
#
#device_location_signal_threshold_dbm=-65



# BTLE random MAC filtering
#
# BTLE incorporates a randomized MAC address model; devices using random MACs will 
# advertise services with a constantly-changing MAC address.  This can flood the logs
# with single-packet devices.
#
# Turning on BTLE Random filtering will *ignore all btle devices with a random mac*. 
# These devices *will not be logged as devices or shown in the ui*, however their
# packets will still be logged in kismetdb and pcap.
#
# Filtering BTLE random devices will prevent a huge overflow of devices in the log and
# UI, however it will also prevent these devices from being shown.

# btle_ignore_random=true


# kismetdb device filtering
#
# By default, the kismetdb log does not filter; if you plan to log only
# specific devices, set the default to 'block' and set specific devices to
# 'pass'.
#
# This does NOT change PACKET logging; for that see the packet filter options

# kis_log_device_filter_default=pass

# Specific devices can be included or excluded from logging based on MAC
# address.  This will filter all devices of that MAC from the log; they
# will still be tracked, but will not be written to the log.
# kis_log_device_filter=phyname,macaddress,value
#
# MACs can be specified as single MACs or as masked MAC groups
#
# kis_log_device_filter=IEEE802.11,aa:bb:cc:dd:ee,pass
# kis_log_device_filter=IEEE802.11,11:22:33:00:00:00/FF:FF:FF:00:00:00,block
#
# To exclude (or add) an entire phy type to the logs, use the '*' wildcard for MAC addresses:
# kis_log_device_filter=802.15.4,*,pass


# kismetdb packet filtering
#
# By default, the kismetdb log does not filter; if you plan to log
# only specific packets, set the default to 'block' and set specific
# packet attributes to 'pass'.
#
# This does NOT change DEVICE logging; if you want to prevent logging 
# information about devices as well as packets, set the corresponding
# device filters.
# 

# kis_log_packet_filter_default=pass

# Packets can be included or excluded from logging based on MAC address by
# source, destination, network, or other; the exact meaning of these
# addresses depends on the PHY type.  For Wi-Fi, the 'other' address is used
# only in WDS 4-mac environments.
# Additionally, packets may be matched on 'any' address.
# Packet filters are defined as:
# kis_log_packet_filter=phyname,addresstype,macaddress,value

# kis_log_packet_filter=IEEE802.11,source,aa:bb:cc:dd:ee,pass

# Filters can also use MAC address group matches:
# kis_log_packet_filter=IEEE802.11,any,11:22:33:00:00:00/ff:ff:ff:00:00:00,block

#
# To exclude (or add) an entire phy type to the logs, use the '*' wildcard for MAC addresses:
# kis_log_packet_filter=802.15.4,any,*,pass
