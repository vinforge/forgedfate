2. Click the **"New"** button or **"+"** in the top right corner
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Repository name: **ForgedFate**
5. Description: **Kismet ForgedFate project with real-time export capabilities**
6. Choose **Public** or **Private** (your preference)
7. **DO NOT** check "Initialize this repository with a README" (we already have files)
8. **DO NOT** add .gitignore or license (we already have them)
9. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push to GitHub
After creating the repository, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### Alternative: If you want to use the ro0TuX777 account
If you have access to the ro0TuX777 GitHub account, you can:

1. Create the repository at **https://github.com/ro0TuX777/ForgedFate**
2. Change the remote back:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/ro0TuX777/ForgedFate.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Authentication Issues?
If you get authentication errors, you may need to:
1. Set up a **Personal Access Token** on GitHub
2. Use the token as your password when prompted
